# Decrypt-Dvmap
This program can decrypt the encrypted files from assets folder of the malware Dvmap.

Im not so professional with Java so sorry if the code haves some failures, this is only for educational purposes.

For compile uses in Terminal linux or Windows "javac DvmapDecrypt.java"

And for uses the compiled code "Java Decrypt <file_path>"
The code decrypt the file and delete the original encrypted
